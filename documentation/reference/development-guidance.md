# Development Guidance

Read this file before changing product code, tests, scripts, or infrastructure.

## Project Structure

```

## Code Style

- Application and service code is TypeScript unless a service defines another stack.
- Use kebab-case filenames, PascalCase classes/interfaces, camelCase functions/variables, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants.
- Keep scripts and infrastructure in their native formats.

## Application Logging

- Use a logging facade when possible.
- Use `info` for useful operations, `error` for failures, and `debug` for deep diagnostics.
- Log network and filesystem operations with relevant context; never log secrets.

## Error Handling and Events

- Use disciplined error boundaries and graceful shutdown.
- Validate required environment variables at startup.
- Use Pub/Sub for service communication when applicable.
- Normalize external events to the internal schema.
